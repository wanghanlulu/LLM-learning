Hell you need even less people now with the advent of the machine that doles out the balls.  This place has none of them.  It is april and there are no grass tees yet.  BTW they opened for the season this week although it has been golfing weather for a month.  The mats look like the carpet at my 107 year old aunt Irene's house.  Worn and thread bare.  Let's talk about the hours.  This place is equipped with lights yet they only sell buckets of balls until 730.  It is still light out.  Finally lets you have the pit to hit into.  When I arrived I wasn't sure if this was a driving range or an excavation site for a mastodon or a strip mining operation.  There is no grass on the range. Just mud.  Makes it a good tool to figure out how far you actually are hitting the ball.  Oh, they are cash only also.\\\\n\\\\nBottom line, this place sucks.  The best hope is that the owner sells it to someone that actually wants to make money and service golfers in Pittsburgh.\"}"

Both stars are basically for the fun layout and beautiful look of this club and the fact that we had a limited open bar until midnight. I've been to Encore Beach Club over half a dozen times and the staff has always been helpful and polite; apparently the same cannot be said for the night time hours when the space becomes Surrender. Took a group of seven girls here for a bachelorette and we were pretty poorly treated. After a night of being treated like royalty at Drai's, I left at like 11:30 because I was just tired of being treated like trash. A few tips- have the female host checking the guest list to make eye contact and not ignore large all girl groups (that's what you wanted in here), have your security not treat well behaved women like criminals, and have all your bartenders be consistent and helpful. You are NOT the nicest club in town anymore, Surrender. Maybe work for it a bit more.</td>\n",

Went down the escalator and to the entrance with ticket in hand and off we go. 2 girls and 2 guys, 50/50 ratio and we got in for free without much of a wait! Awesome!\\n\\nAs for the club itself...its alright. It is kinda like \\\"jet\\\" in that the layout doesnt really have a large dance floor. Stripper pole in the center and mainly a wide aisle around to dance. It was only about 11pm and alraedy it was super crowded! Its vegas...how could it be so crowded already?! Music was pretty good that night. Lots of bars, maybe 3. When you walk into club you have to take the stairs down to the dance floor otherwise you head up to the catwalk/upstairs area and see really how crowded the dance floor is!\\n\\nthe only good thing about that whole evening there was the fact we got our guys in for free.\\n\\nDrinks were expensive as usual! $18 for a grey goose on the rocks. We asked for a cranberry chaser on the side. \\n\\nThe crowd was mixed with average looking. I didn't like how crowded it was and how difficult it was to find a place to stand or even dance! \\n\\nWould I go again?

All the servers were really friendly and I was greeted quickly and politely by two when I walked in. One server told me they had only been open two days, so I was pleasantly surprised by how big a crowd of diners they had attracted. \\n\\nTheir menu is extensive. I noticed soup dumplings and got excited, but since I was doing takeout I knew that was a no-go. Next time for sure. I ended up with the pork and cabbage dumplings and a taro slush with boba. My dumplings came out first and were packaged well to go. I had hoped for some sauces or something, but I just used some stuff I had at home to dip them in. My taro slush wasn't amazing. It was a little on the thick side and too sweet. Not my favorite in town, but they have quite a few flavors, so I'd be interested in trying some of their less conventional flavors. \\n\\nI tried some dumplings as soon as I got home and they were good. Lots of meat and pretty flavorful. Not the best I've ever had, but solid and a huge portion for the price. They're a new spot, so I give them the benefit of the doubt and I look forward to trying a few more of their menu items in the future.</td>\n",
